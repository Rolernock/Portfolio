                <p class="mb1">I'm a passionate Kenyan who loves creating simple stylish things with code. I believe in continuous learning which helps me level up one day at a time.</p>
                <p class="mb1">Programming introduced itself to me before I even realised what it is. Just imagine joining campus and being told that C is a language with no technical background, I felt like a monkey in the house, though I found it interesting, Imagine being interested in something you have no idea about, and that even made it more interesting, Oooh! C was the sub-structure to my Javascript, I think I've found something worth growing old for, wanna know more about me!. Contact.</p>
                <p>I came to realise that developers do rarely communicate with the client throughout the process resulting to final product that fails to reach the expectation of the client. For that reason, I do focus highly on communication during the process to come up with expected design patterns, I usually give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly with the clients expectation.</p>
